Critics of the 28th regime proposal point to several significant challenges:

- **Harmonization Difficulties:** Achieving consensus across member states is tough due to entrenched national legal traditions and different approaches to sensitive areas like labor law, taxation, and corporate governance. Many fear that even an optional regime could face delays or uneven uptake if nations cannot agree on a balanced level of harmonization. citeturn0search0

- **Political Feasibility and Sovereignty Concerns:** Some policymakers question whether member states will be willing to cede even limited control over national legal frameworks. There’s worry that the proposal might be seen as undermining national sovereignty or imposing an “old Europe” mindset, especially by countries with dynamic regulatory environments. citeturn0search10

- **Risk of Fragmentation and Bureaucracy:** Because the regime is optional, companies might selectively opt in or out, potentially reinforcing existing market fragmentation rather than creating a unified internal market. Critics also argue that additional layers of regulation could lead to more bureaucracy without delivering the promised efficiency gains.

- **Impact on SMEs:** There is concern that the framework might favor larger firms able to navigate complex legal systems, leaving small and medium-sized enterprises at a disadvantage in accessing cross-border investments.

In summary, while the 28th regime is seen as a tool to streamline cross-border business operations and foster innovation, its success hinges on overcoming significant political, legal, and practical hurdles that remain under intense debate.
