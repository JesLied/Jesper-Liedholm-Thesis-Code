To evaluate if lowering investment barriers would attract more international investment, I'd recommend using the **OECD FDI Regulatory Restrictiveness Index** as your primary measure, supplemented by the **Heritage Foundation’s Investment Freedom Index**.

### Why the OECD FDI Regulatory Restrictiveness Index?

**Advantages:**
- Specifically designed to measure regulatory barriers to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI).
- Covers explicit legal restrictions such as equity limits, screening procedures, restrictions on key foreign personnel, and operational constraints.
- Detailed sectoral breakdowns allow targeted policy analysis, valuable for assessing precise regulatory changes.

**How to Use It:**
- Use the OECD Index to track changes over time as barriers decrease.
- Correlate index movements with actual FDI inflows or cross-border investment trends to empirically demonstrate policy impacts.

### Supplementary: Investment Freedom Index (Heritage Foundation)

**Advantages:**
- Reflects both formal restrictions and informal barriers (bureaucratic efficiency, regulatory transparency, rule of law).
- Useful for providing a broader context beyond just explicit legal restrictions.

### Methodological Approach:
- **Before-after comparison**:  
  Track countries' rankings/scores before and after policy implementation.
- **Comparative analysis**:  
  Compare performance of countries reducing investment barriers to those maintaining or increasing barriers.
- **Regression analysis**:  
  Econometrically test the relationship between scores on these indices and observed international investment flows.

### Limitations and Considerations:

1. **Limitations of OECD FDI Regulatory Restrictiveness Index:**
   - **Static nature:** Primarily measures formal regulatory frameworks. Informal barriers or institutional effectiveness (corruption, bureaucracy) aren't fully captured.
   - **Sector-specific constraints:** May overlook nuances in specific sectors not covered extensively.

2. **Limitations of Investment Freedom Index:**
   - **Subjectivity:** Contains qualitative judgments, potentially introducing biases.
   - **Broad nature:** Combines various elements into a single score, reducing granularity in identifying specific barrier reductions' impacts.

3. **General Methodological Limitations:**
   - Indices provide proxies; correlation with actual investment flows isn't always straightforward due to external factors (macroeconomic stability, geopolitical events).
   - Investor decisions depend on multiple variables beyond regulatory openness, such as market size, growth expectations, labor market conditions, and infrastructure.

### Recommendation:

**Optimal approach:**  
- Primarily use **OECD’s Index** for quantitative, precise measurement of regulatory barrier changes.  
- Supplement your analysis with the **Heritage Investment Freedom Index** or broader metrics from the **Global Competitiveness Index** to capture qualitative, institutional, and economic context.

This combined approach allows you to clearly isolate the effects of regulatory reforms on international investments while accounting for broader market conditions and informal institutional barriers.
